Even though it can look easy, there are quite a few implementation details to review when performing such audit. In this document we are going to review what we believe are the most important things to check, separated by technical area. \r\n\r\n**Version Control System:**\r\n\r\nWhether the engineers are using version control, which system and using what process tells us a lot of things about the software development process. \r\n\r\n* Do you have a properly configured *ignore file so IDE metadata files and other extraneous elements are not under version control?\r\n\r\n* Are third party libraries versioned in the repository rather than configured as an external dependency?\r\n\r\n* Do you use sufficiently concise and descriptive commit messages?\r\n\r\n* Is the size of the commits reasonable?\r\n\r\n* Are all the files in a commit related to the same issue or feature?\r\n\r\n* Are you using branches following any branching scheme like \"feature branch\" or “git-flow”? \r\n\r\n* Are these branch names descriptive enough?\r\n\r\n* Are you using the pull request/code review system before merging the code into master?\r\n\r\n    * Do you have any guidelines regarding what to look for when reviewing a PR?\r\n\r\n    * How many comments on average for every PR?\r\n\r\n    * How many people review each PR?\r\n\r\n    * How many +1 do you need before merging?\r\n\r\n    * Who is responsible for closing the branch?\r\n\r\n* Are you using release branches to prepare every release?\r\n\r\n* How long are your staging process open?\r\n\r\n* How many fixes do you introduce into your release candidate before to release it?\r\n\r\n* Are you able to checkout the exact code used to build any of the published versions of your app?\r\n\r\n* How many hotfixes have you released in the past year?\r\n\r\n* Are you squashing the commits in a branch before merging it into the master/develop/ branch?\r\n\r\n* Is the master/develop branch ready to be released at any time?\r\n\r\n**Build Tools:** \r\n\r\nBeing able to reproduce the build process on every developer machine and any other external system as continuous integration is key.\r\n\r\n* How many libraries are being used in the project?\r\n\r\n* Is the project splitted into different modules?\r\n\r\n* Do they consume their dependencies from Maven or Gradle or are they using local jars?\r\n\r\n* Is the project dangerously approaching to the dex method count limit? Is it already beyond that point?\r\n\r\n* Are you using libraries your project does not need?\r\n\r\n* Is the project using multidex?\r\n\r\n* Are the external dependencies up to date?\r\n\r\n* Are you respecting every third party library license?\r\n\r\n* Is the project using any deprecated or abandoned/unmaintained third party library?\r\n\r\n* Is the minimum SDK the one required by the product description?\r\n\r\n* Is the target SDK up to date?\r\n\r\n* Is proguard, or any other obfuscation tool, enabled and properly configured?\r\n\r\n* Are the keystore credentials and Google Play Store credentials stored in a secure place?\r\n\r\n* Is the application keystore and the credential stored in a secure place?\r\n\r\n* Does the application use build types properly?\r\n\r\n* Does the application use flavors properly?\r\n\r\n* Is the release build type properly configured?\r\n\r\n* Is the backup option enabled?\r\n\r\n* Is lint enabled and successfully passing?\r\n\r\n* Is there any static analysis tool configured and passing?\r\n\r\n* Is there any checkstyle configured and passing?\r\n\r\n* Is the application id and version name/code configured properly?\r\n\r\n* Are you using any structure or strategy for versioning the id?\r\n\r\n* Is there any continous integration tool configured?\r\n\r\n* Is the release process automated?\r\n\r\n**Android Resources Usage:**\r\n\r\nThere is a wide range of devices in the Android world, each one with their own screen size, capabilities, etc. You need to be extra careful and leverage some of the Android tools to provide the best possible experience to your user regardless of their device.\r\n\r\n* Are there any missing resources for densities, flavors or build types?\r\n\r\n* Does the application support all the densities required by the product description?\r\n\r\n* Does the application use drawable/mipmap, fonts or vectorial resources?\r\n\r\n* Are there any missing translations?\r\n\r\n* Is the translation process automated?\r\n\r\n* What is the default language for translations?\r\n\r\n* Does the application use custom fonts?\r\n\r\n* Does the application use configuration values inside the String resources file?\r\n\r\n* Is the naming convention used to assign names to the resources homogeneous?\r\n\r\n* Are configuration parameters related to the device hardware configured properly?\r\n\r\n* Are you supporting tablets?\r\n\r\n**Android Layout Usage:**\r\n\r\nAs we have said before, there is a wide range of Android devices in the world, each one with it own screen size and density.
